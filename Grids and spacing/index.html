    <h1>Grids and spacing</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Grids are made up of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines</p>

    <h2>Grid Types</h2>

    <p>There are various types of grids.</p>
    <p>Most common type of grid a web designer uses is the column grid. It breaks up the page into vertical units that span the width of the content</p>

    <h2>Grid Anatomy</h2>

    <p>When designing a website, the grid comprises three major components. Columns, gutters and margins.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Columns. Vertical sections that span the width of the page. It is common to see layouts with 12 or 16 columns, but some might only have 3. Defining the number of columns depends on what is appropriate for your design.</li>
            <li>Gutter. The space between each column. They help ensure the columns don't run together.</li>
            <li>Margins. They appear on the LHS, or RHS of the column-based grid.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>Grid Columns</h2>

    <p>Columns are vertical containers that span the width of the page</p>
    <p>Content can span multiple columns. Meaning a website does not need to maintain the same column layout throughout</p>
    <p>You are allowed to decide how much the content can span.</p>
    <p>No content can spill into the gutter unless it is using the next column</p>
    <p>Columns can be used to push, or offset content. Assume you want to display content on the furthest 4 right column while using a 12 column grid. You can offset teh content by 8 columns so the content is pushed to the right 4 columns</p>

    <h2>Grid Rows</h2>

    <p>Rows are horizontal lines on a grid</p>
    <p>Think of rows as invisible boxes that group content together by height</p>

    <h3>I dont understand this "Grid Rows" segment</h3>

    <hr>
    <h2>Grid Gutters</h2>

    <p>This element provides a natural break between elements aligned horizontally. While also helping to break rows of content vertically</p>

    <p>There is no set standard for gutter width, its best practice is to select a size that visually separates horizontal columns, but is thinner than the width of a column</p>
    <p>Same can be said for vertical gutters.</p>

    <h3>I am so confused. It keeps saying horizontal columns?? How does that make sense? It showing picture of a gutter that is vertical that is between the columns and its talking about horizontal columns??</h3>

    <p>Horizontal and vertical gutters do not need to match in size for a given grid layout</p>

    <p>If the gutter space is too tight, it will be hard to visually tell where one element ends and another starts. Yet if it is too large, the design can be hard to follow/</p>

    <h2>Responsive Grid</h2>

    <p>Many websites utilize responsive design, a set of techniques that allow a websites content to shift based on the device or screen size</p>
    <p>Responsive design requires a different number of total columns based on a screen size.</p>
    <p>It is a common practice to create a responsive grid size. On a desktop you may have 12 column grid, but a mobile size, you might have a 4 column grid.</p>
    <p>Allowing responsive design ensures a seamless/accessible experience for users.</p>

    <h2>Whitespace</h2>

    <p>It is important to understand how to use whitespace, as it can enhance designs or hurt it.</p>
    <p>Whitespace is just the emptiness between elements</p>
    <p>Whitespace doesn't have to be white</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Passive Whitespace</h2>

    <p>Also known as micro white space, it is used to improve the aesthetics of the layout without guiding the user through a specific reading, flow, or content order</p>
    <p>Font families have different amounts of passive whitespace, and you can control aspects of them within your design such as line-height or margin</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Active Whitespace</h2>

    <p>Active whitespace is intentional, since passive whitespace occurs more naturally</p>
    <p>Also known as macro whitespace, active whitespace refers to enhancing the overall page structure through space to emphasize content or guide users from one point to the next</p>
    <p>Adding active whitespace to a site's design, we can spread different sections out, helping the user guide through the page's content more effectively.</p>

    <h2>Quiz</h2>

    <p>If a width of a grid is a set to a specific width, we would consider this to be what type of a grid?</p>
    <p>Fixed</p>

    <p>What is another term used to describe whitespace?</p>
    <p>Negative space</p>
