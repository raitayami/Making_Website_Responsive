    <h1>GRID ESSENTIALS</h1>

    <h2>Introduction to grids</h2>
    <p>The Box Model, Display and Positioning explain some possible ways to style layout</p>
    <p>The grid can be used to layout entire web pages.</p>
    <p>Flexbox is mostly useful for positioning items in a 1d layout</p>

    <h2>Creating a grid</h2>

    <p>To set up a grid, you need to have both, a grid container and grid items</p>

    <p>The grid container will be a parent element that contains grid items as children</p>
    <p>To turn a HTML element into a grid container, you have to set the element's display property to one of the two values. grid - for a block-level grid. inline-grid - for an inline grid</p>

    <div class="grid1">
        <div class="box box1">1</div>
        <div class="box box2">2</div>
        <div class="box box3">3</div>
        <div class="box box4">4</div>
        <div class="box box5">5</div>
    </div>

    <hr>
    <h2>Creating columns</h2>

    <p>By default, grids contain only one column. If you were to start adding items, each item would be put on a new row. To add columns, you need to explicitly define teh number of rows, columns in the grid</p>

    <p>You can define the columns for the grid by using the CSS property, grid-template-columns.</p>

    <p>Below is an example</p>

    <div class="grid2">
        <div class="box box6"></div>
        <div class="box box7"></div>
        <div class="box box8"></div>
        <div class="box box9"></div>
    </div>

    <p>Looking at the styles page. there are two values, so two columns. Each column has its width. You can use percentages as well as pixels,and you can use both.</p>

    <p>We will learn how to handle overflow if the sum of with column's width exceeds the width of the grid</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Creating Rows</h2>

    <p>To specify the number and size of rows, we are going to use the property grid-template-rows</p>

    <div class="grid3">
        <div class="box box10"></div>
        <div class="box box11"></div>
        <div class="box box12"></div>
        <div class="box box13"></div>
        <div class="box box14"></div>
        <div class="box box15"></div>
    </div>

    <p>When using percentages in the specifying of rows/columns properties, remember that rows are defined as a percentages of grid's height, columns are defined as a percentage of grid's width
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Grid Template</h2>

    <p>This is a shorthand property. Grid-template can replace the previous two CSS properties.</p>

    <p>When using grid-template, the values before the slash determines the size of each row. The values after determines the size of each column.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Fraction</h2>

    <p>As you have seen a few types of responsive units, such as %, em and rem. CSS Grid introduces a new relative sizing unit - fr (fraction)</p>

    <p>Using fr unit, we can define the size of columns, and rows, as a fraction of the grid's length and width. This unit was specifically created for use in CSS grid</p>


    <p>Using fr makes it easier to prevent grid items from overflowing the boundaries of the grid</p>

    <div class="grid4">
        <div class="box box16">250px height - 80px width</div>
        <div class="box box17"> 250px height - 240px width</div>
        <div class="box box18">250px height - 80px width</div>
        <div class="box box19">125px height - 80px width</div>
        <div class="box box20">125px height - 240px width</div>
    </div>

    <p>The example above, has 3 rows and 3 columns.</p>
    <p>The rows are splitting up the available 400 pixels of height into 4 parts. First row gets 2 of those part, second and third gets one each.</p>

    <p>Each column's width is a fraction of the available space</p>
    <p>Just think, of the space is being split into parts (the fr)</p>

    <p>You can mix and match the units together, a set of columns can be described in fr, %, px</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Repeat</h2>

    <p>repeat() is a function. It can duplicated the specifications for rows or columns, a given number of times</p>

    <p>Instead of writing 100px 100px 100px (which specifies three columns to be each 100px wide), you can do repeat(3, 100px)</p>

    <p>You can include a second parameter too, so repeat(2, 20px, 50px)</p>
    <p>This will create 4 columns, where the first and third is 20px wide, second and fourth is 50px wide</p>

    <p>You can use it with fr too</p>

    <div class="grid5">
        <div class="box box21"></div>
        <div class="box box22"></div>
        <div class="box box23"></div>
        <div class="box box24"></div>
        <div class="box box25"></div>
        <div class="box box26"></div>
        <div class="box box27"></div>
        <div class="box box28"></div>
        <div class="box box29"></div>
        <div class="box box30"></div>
    </div>

    <hr>
    <h2>Minmax</h2>

    <p>Sometimes you might want a grid to resize based on the size of your web browser</p>

    <p>Situations such as preventing a row or column from getting to big or small.</p>

    <p>100px minmax(100px, 500px) 100px</p>

    <p>The value above tells us that the 1st and 3rd columns will always be 100px wide, no matter the size of the gird. But the second column will vary in size as the overall grid resizes. The second column will always be between 100 and 500 px wide.</p>

    <div class="grid6">
            <div class="box box31"></div>
            <div class="box box32"></div>
            <div class="box box33"></div>
            <div class="box box34"></div>
            <div class="box box35"></div>
            <div class="box box36"></div>
            <div class="box box37"></div>
            <div class="box box38"></div>
            <div class="box box39"></div>
            <div class="box box40"></div>
    </div>


    <hr>
    <h2>Grid Gap</h2>

    <p>So far in our grids, there hasn't been any space between the items in our grid. Row-gap or column-gap will put blank space between every row or column in the grid</p>

    <p>There is also a shorthand property, gap. It doesn't have the slash like other shorthand properties. The first specifies the row gap, then the column gap. If only one value is given, it will set both the column and row gap to that value</p>


    <hr>
    <h2>Grid Items</h2>

    <p>so far the examples we have used, each item in the grid has taken up one square. This does not always need to be the case. We can drastically change the look of the grid by making the grid item take up more than one row or one column.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Multiple Row Items</h2>

    <p>Grid-row-start or grid-row-end, we can make a single grid item take up multiple rows. WE ARE NOT APPLYING TO THE GIRD CONTAINER BUT RATHER, ADDING CSS TO THE ITEM IN THE GRID</p>

    <p>For example. If a grid has 5 rows, the grid row lines range from 1 to 6.</p>
    <p>The value of grid-row-start should be the row at which you want the grid item to begin. The value for grid-row-end should be one greater than the row at which you want the grid item to end. Therefore, an element that covers rows 2,3,4 should have declarations such as grid-row-start: 2, grid-row-end: 5</p>

    <p>It is possible for the value of grid-row-start to be greater than grid-row-end, it will still cover, but look awkward on the declarations. they can also have negative values, check the MDN docs</p>


    <div class="grid7">
        <div class="box box41"></div>
        <div class="box box42"></div>
        <div class="box box43"></div>
        <div class="box box44"></div>
        <div class="box box45"></div>
    </div>

    <hr>
    <h2>Grid Row</h2>

    <p>We can use grid-row as a shorthand for grid-row-start and grid-row-end</p>
    <p>The starting row goes before the / and the ending row goes after it.</p>

    <p>It shall include the gap measurements too if it exists. An item spanning two rows of height 100px each with a 10px gap, the item will be a total height of 210 px</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Grid Column</h2>

    <p>Same for grid-column</p>
    <p>when using these properties, you can use keyword span to start or end a column or row</p>

    <p>grid-column: 4 / span 2. this code tells us the item begins in column 4,takes up 2 columns of space. thus item occupies columns 4 and 5</p>

    <p>Span helps us avoid errors when determining the ending of the grid line. If you know where you wan your grid item to start and how long it should be, use span.</p>
    
    <hr>
    <h2>Grid Area</h2>

    <p>This is a shorthand for all of the grid-row/column-start/end property</p>

    <p>Grid area takes four values. First value, grid-row-start, second value, grid-colum-start, third value, grid-row-end, fourth value, grid-column-end</p>

    <p>grid-area: 2 / 3 / 4 / span 5</p>

    <p>The item will start row 2 and end row 4. row 4 is not included though, only 2 and 3. the item also start on column 3 spanning 5 columns, so 3,4,5,6,7.</p>

    <h1>Advanced CSS Grid</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <h3>Codecademy example: </h3>

    <div class="container">
        <header><h1>Header</h1></header>
        <nav><h1>Nav</h1></nav>
        <section class="left"><h2>Left</h2></section>
        <section class="right"><h2>Right</h2></section>
        <footer><h1>Footer</h1></footer>
    </div>


    <h3>My example:</h3>

    <div class="container2">
        <header><h1>Calisthenics</h1></header>
        <nav><h1>List Of Nav Bars</h1></nav>

        <section class="testimonial3"><h2>Testimonial 3</h2></section>
        <section class="callToAction"><h3>A Form</h3></section>
    </div>

    <hr>
    <h2>Overlapping Elements</h2>

    <p>Using z-index. you can overlap elements. Also i don't know why they used 5 in the example.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Justify Items</h2>

    <p>There are two axes in the grid layout. The column or block axis. The row or inline axis.</p>

    <p>The column axis stretches from top to bottom across the web page</p>
    <p>The row axis stretches from left to right across the web page</p>

    <p>Justify items positions grid items along the inline or row axis.</p>
    <p>This means it positions items from left to right across the web page</p>

    <p>This property is declared on grid containers</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Start. Aligns grid items to the left side of the grid area</li>
        <li>End. Aligns grid items to the right side of the grid area</li>
        <li>Center. Aligns grid items to the center of the grid area</li>
        <li>Stretch. Stretches all the  grid items to fill the grid area</li>
        <li>There are more values and it can be found on MDN. These are the main ones listed above</li>
    </ul>

    <section class="container3">
        <div class="card card1">Card 1</div>
        <div class="card card2">Card 2</div>
        <div class="card card3">Card 3</div>

    </section>

    <hr>
    <h2>Justify Content</h2>

    <p>In this exercise we will learn how to position a grid within its parent element</p>

    <p>We can use justify-content to position the entire grid along the row axis. This property is declared on grid containers</p>

    <p>The values it accepts are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start. Aligns grid to the left side of the grid container</li>
        <li>End. Aligns grid to the right side of the grid container</li>
        <li>Center. Centers the grid horizontally in the grid container</li>
        <li>Stretch. Stretches the grid items to increase the size of the grid to expand horizontally across the container</li>
        <li>Space-around. Includes an equal amount of spae on each side of a grid element</li>
        <li>Space-between. Includes an equal amount of space between grid items and no space at either end</li>
        <li>Space-evenly. Places an even amount of space between grid items and at either end</li>

    </ul>

    <section class="container4">
        <div class="left2">Left</div>
        <div class="right2">Right</div>
    </section>

    <hr>
    <h2>Align Items</h2>
    <p>Align items shows us how to position grid items from top to bottom</p>
    <p>Align-items is a property that positions grid items along the block/column axis. It is declared on grid containers</p>
    
    <p>The values it accepts are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start. Aligns grid items to the top side of the grid area</li>
        <li>End. Aligns grid items to the bottom side of the grid area</li>
        <li>Center. Aligns grid items to the center of the grid area</li>
        <li>Stretch. Stretches all items to fill the grid area</li>

    </ul>

    <hr>
    <h2>Align Content</h2>

    <p>Same as Justify Content, but top to bottom.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Justify Self and Align Self</h2>

    <p>The justify-items and align-items properties specify how all grid items contained within a single container will position themselves along the row and column axes.</p>

    <p>Justify-self specifies how an individual element should position itself with respect to the row axis. This property overrides justify-items for any item on which it is declared. Align self the same but respect to the column axis.</p>

    <p>These properties are declared on grid items.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Start. Positions grid items on the left side/top of the grid area</li>
        <li>End. Positions grid items on the right side/bottom of the grid area</li>
        <li>Center. Positions grid items on the center of the grid area</li>
        <li>Stretch. Positions grid items to fill the grid area</li>

    </ul>


    <hr>
    <h2>Implicit vs Explicit Grid</h2>

    <p>So far we have been explicitly defining the dimensions and quantities of our grid elements using various properties</p>
    <p>There will be instances where we don't know how much information we are going to display.</p>

    <p>this is where implicit grid comes in handy. Implicit grid is an algorithm built into the specification for CSS Grid, that determines default behavior for the placement of elements</p>

    <p>The default behavior of the implicit grid is, items fill up the rows first, adding new rows as necessary. New rows will be tall enough to contain the content within them.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Grid Auto Rows, Grid Auto Columns</h2>

    <p>CSS Grid provides two properties to specify the size of grid tracks added implicitly. Grid-auto-rows, grid-auto-columns. These properties are declared on grid containers</p>

    <p>Grid-auto-rows specifies the height of implicitly added grid rows.</p>
    <p>Grid-column-rows specifies the width of implicitly added grid columns.</p>

    <p>The values accepted are, px, %, fr, repeat()</p>

    <section class="container5">
        <div class="part part1">Part 1</div>
        <div class="part part2">Part 2</div>
        <div class="part part3">Part 3</div>
        <div class="part part4">Part 4</div>
        <div class="part part5">Part 5</div>
    </section>

    <hr>
    <h2>Grid Auto Flow</h2>

    <p>In addition to setting the dimensions of implicitly-added rows and columns, we can specify the order in which they are rendered</p>

    <p>Grid-auto-flow specifies whether new elements should be added to rows or columns, and it is declared on containers</p>

    <p>The values that are accepted are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Row - specifies the new elements should fill rows from left to right and create new rows when there are too many elements (default).</li>
        <li>Column - specifies the new elements should fill columns from top to bottom, and create new columns when there are too many elements</li>
        <li>Dense - this keywords invokes an algorithm that attempts to fill holes earlier in the grid layout if smaller elements are added.</li>
        <li>You can pair row dense like this, or column dense like this.</li>
    </ul>


    <hr>
    <h2>Quiz</h2>

    <p>Question 1</p>

    <p>Imagine we have a grid with 2 explicitly defined rows and 2 explicitly defined columns and no other grid properties set in the CSS, with the following divs inside of it. If we added a div, with class box, called E, to the HTML after box D, where would box E appear on the page?</p>

    <p>Imagine there is 4 divs, each with class box, the names are ranging from A, B, C, D</p>

    <p>It would appear underneath box C in a new row. the default is for the grid to implicitly create new rows, unless grid-auto-flow specifies it sets to column</p>

    <p>Question 2</p>

    <p>Which justify-content value would you use to have an even amount of space between the grid items, with half-sized spaces on the far ends?</p>

    <p>Space around. (space-evenly puts a full space at each end)</p>

    <p>Question 3</p>

    <p>Imagine we have a grid with 4 items in it, with the following CSS properties. What width would the 3rd column be?</p>

    <p>the grid has property of grid-auto-columns: 100px 200px, and grid-auto-flow: columns</p>

    <p>100px because the boxes will fill up implicitly created columns which alternate between being 100px and 200px. Odd rows will be 100px in size.</p>
